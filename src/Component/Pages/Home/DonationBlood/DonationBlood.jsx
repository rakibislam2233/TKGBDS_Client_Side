          <h2>
            Blood donation is the process of voluntary donation of blood by a
            healthy adult. This donated blood is transfused or fractionated into
            medicine. Most blood donors in developed countries are voluntary
            blood donors, who donate blood out of social responsibility. In poor
            countries, the number of such established voluntary blood donors is
            quite low, with most donors only donating blood to those they know.
            Most blood donors donate blood as a community service act, but some
            people are professional blood donors, meaning they donate blood for
            money or an allowance. Again the blood donor can get blood for his
            future needs. Donating blood is relatively safe, but some donors
            experience soreness where the needle is inserted, and others
            experience weakness after donating. All factors that may make the
            use of a potential blood donor's blood risky are checked. These
            tests include tests for blood-borne diseases (such as HIV and viral
            hepatitis). The blood donor is asked about his medical history and
            undergoes a brief physical examination to ensure that donating blood
            will not harm his body. How long a blood donor can donate blood in a
            row depends on what he is donating and the laws of the country where
            the donation is being made. However, every four months ie after 120
            days, new blood is created in the human body. The amount and method
            of blood drawn can vary, but typically 500 milliliters (or about 1
            US pint)[1] of whole blood is drawn. Most of the blood components
            used in transfusions have a short life, and thus ensuring a constant
            supply is a constant problem.
